# AtheonTrainer
Impress your loved ones, friends, and pets by memorizing the oracle tones used during the Vault of Glass Atheon boss battle!

Special thanks to [u/GigaGamer_Gabe](https://www.reddit.com/u/GigaGamer_Gabe) for a link he posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/nk8sqt/oracle_sound_trainer/) to a dump of sound files that allowed me to make this!
